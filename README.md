<h1>My Contract-App</h1>
<p>This is a contract App for businesses and individuals made in Laravel where businesses can give individuals contracts and also businesses assigned to qualified personnel for a specific task</p>
<p>Both the businesses and the people are added to the contract database by an administrator who assigns tasks to them</p>
<p>The app acts as a 3rd party agency that unites businesses and people looking for contracts and tasks</p>

<h2>Task Assignment</h2>
<p>When a new task is assigned, both the business and the person assigned for the task are notified via email provided on the database</p>

<h1>Tools used</h1>
<p>I used php-laravel and mysql databases to develop the website. You can import the database and work on it</p>
